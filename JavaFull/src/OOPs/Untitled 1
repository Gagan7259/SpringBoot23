class -- class is a template to construct objects


OOPS:-OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMING IN JAVA
1.Abstraction
2.Encapsulation
3.Inheritence
4.PolymorPhism
      Main thing to know A.CLASS
                         B.Metod Signature
                         C.THIS keyword

4 pillers of OOPS Conmcept
Abstraction:-
Inheritance:- reusable code 
               reuse the functionality and adding new features
               reusing the functions and methods one class to another class and adding new features
               simple Inheritance -reuse code in one class to another class
               multilevel inheritance-- reuse code one class to more other classes
               hyrarcial inheritance
              
Encapsulation:- 
PolyMorphism :-
